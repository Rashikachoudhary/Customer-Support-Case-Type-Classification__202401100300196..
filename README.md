# ðŸ“¬ Customer Support Case Type Classifier
To automate and streamline this process, we propose a machine learning model that classifies customer support cases into three categories: Billing, Technical, or General.
A simple Python machine learning project to classify customer support queries into three categories:

-  **Billing**
-  **Technical**
-  **General**
This project uses **Logistic Regression** with **TF-IDF vectorization** to perform text classification on support case messages

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classifies support case messages into categories.
- Uses scikit-learn's pipeline for simplicity and scalability.
- Automatically detects text and category columns from your CSV.
- Saves the trained model using `joblib`.
- Includes a section to predict new unseen support queries.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/)
